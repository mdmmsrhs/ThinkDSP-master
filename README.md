========

LaTeX source and Python code for _Think DSP: Digital Signal Processing in Python_, by Allen B. Downey.

The premise of this book (and the other books in the _Think X_ series) is that if you know how to program,
you can use that skill to learn other things.  I am writing this book because I think the conventional
approach to digital signal processing is backward: most books (and the classes that use them) present
the material bottom-up, starting with mathematical abstractions like phasors.

With a programming-based approach, I can go top-down, which means I can present the most important
ideas right away.  By the end of the first chapter, you can
break down a sound into its harmonics, modify the harmonics, and generate new sounds.
